extension settings for user to choose how they want to display the cheater and add the documentation of each setting in readme
make rank 0 and graph 0 (need to check if this is doable or not)
option: the user can hide the cheaters rank graph from profile and show the contests he has cheated in
Do something with the rating(making it negative makes sense)
